### HD Texture Mod for Dissidia 012 on the PSP

This project aims to completely retexture Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy for the PSP. 

The original game was designed to be viewed on a small 480 x 272 PSP display, which is fine for the time, but low-res and blurry on modern display sizes. The current aim is to replace all textures in the game<sup>1</sup> with new hand-made textures that scale nicely to 1080p.


<sup>1: Some text uses the PSP's internal font and to my knowledge, there is no way to upscale it to my knowledge.</sup>
